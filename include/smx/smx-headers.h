    // format called ".amxx" as a "universal binary" for 32-bit and 64-bit
    // plugins. This format dropped compact encoding, but supported gzip. The
    // disksize/imagesize oddness made its way to this file format. When .smx
    // was created for SourceMod, it persisted even though AMX was dropped
