 *
 *  Codepage translation to Unicode, and UTF-8 support
 *
 *  The translation is based on codepage mapping files that are distributed
 *  by the Unicode consortium, see ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/.
 *
 *  Character sets with a maximum of 256 codes are translated via a lookup
 *  table (these are Single-Byte Character Sets). Character sets like Shift-JIS
 *  with single-byte characters and multi-byte characters (introduced by a
 *  leader byte) are split into two tables: the 256-entry lookup table for
 *  the single-byte characters and an extended table for the multi-byte
 *  characters. The extended table is allocated dynamically; the lookup table
 *  is allocated statically, so loading SBCS tables cannot fail (if the tables
 *  themselves are valid, of course).
